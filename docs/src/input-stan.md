# [Stan model as input to pigeons](@id input-stan)

!!! note

    We use the package `BridgeStan.jl` as a package extension which will attempt 
    to automatically install Stan. 
    For `BridgeStan.jl` to work, a C++ compiler and 
    `make` are needed, see 
    [the BridgeStan requirements](https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/latest/getting-started.html#requirement-c-toolchain).


To target the posterior distribution specified by 
a [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) model, use 
a [`StanLogPotential`](@ref). 

Here we show how this is done using our familiar [unidentifiable toy example](@ref unidentifiable-example)
[ported to the Stan language](https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/Pigeons.jl/blob/main/examples/stan/unid.stan).

```@example stan
using BridgeStan
using Pigeons 
using Random

# We will use this type to make sure our iid sampler (next section) will 
# be used only for this model
struct StanUnidentifiableExample end

function stan_unid(n_trials, n_successes)
    # path to a .stan file (compiled files will be cached in the same directory)
    stan_file = dirname(dirname(pathof(Pigeons))) * "/examples/stan/unid.stan"

    # data can be specified either using...
    #   - a path to a json file with suffix .json containing the data to condition on
    #   - the JSON string itself (here via the utility Pigeons.json())
    stan_data = Pigeons.json(; n_trials, n_successes)

    return StanLogPotential(stan_file, stan_data, StanUnidentifiableExample())
end

pt = pigeons(target = stan_unid(100, 50), reference = stan_unid(0, 0))
nothing #hide
```

Notice that we have specified a reference distribution, in this case the same model but with 
no observations (hence the prior). This needs to be done with Stan targets because it is 
not possible to automatically extract a prior from a .stan file. 

For a [`StanLogPotential`](@ref), the [`default_explorer()`](@ref) is [`AutoMALA`](@ref). 



## Sampling from the reference distribution

Ability to sample from the reference distribution can be beneficial, e.g. to jump modes 
in multi-modal distribution. 
For stan targets, this is done as follows:

```@example stan
using BridgeStan

function Pigeons.sample_iid!(
        log_potential::StanLogPotential{M, S, D, StanUnidentifiableExample}, replica, shared) where {M, S, D}
    # sample in constrained space
    constrained = rand(replica.rng, 2)
    # transform to unconstrained space
    replica.state.unconstrained_parameters .= BridgeStan.param_unconstrain(log_potential.model, constrained)
end

pt = pigeons(target = stan_unid(100, 50), reference = stan_unid(0, 0))
nothing # hide
```


## Manipulating the output

Internally, Stan target's states are stored in an unconstrained 
parameterization provided by Stan 
(for example, bounded support variables are mapped to the full real line). 
However, sample post-processing functions such as [`sample_array()`](@ref) and [`process_sample()`](@ref) 
convert back to the original ("constrained") parameterization via [`extract_sample()`](@ref). 

As a result parameterization issues can be essentially ignored when post-processing, for example some 
common post-processing are shown below, see [the section on output processing for more information](@ref output-overview). 

```@example stan
using MCMCChains
using StatsPlots
plotlyjs()

pt = pigeons(
        target = stan_unid(100, 50), 
        reference = stan_unid(0, 0), 
        record = [traces])
samples = Chains(sample_array(pt), variable_names(pt))
my_plot = StatsPlots.plot(samples)
StatsPlots.savefig(my_plot, "stan_posterior_densities_and_traces.html");
