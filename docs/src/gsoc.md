## Python and R Interface for Pigeons

Pigeons allows users to scale their Bayesian computation on up to thousands of 
machines. At the moment, the only available API is through the Julia programming 
language. To reach a wider audience, we would like to extend this to Python and R.
Work on this project would include: 

- Development of a new Pigeons interface in Python and/or R.

- Testing of the new interface to ensure identical output to Julia.  

- Engaging with researchers interested in using a Python/R interface and implementing additional suggested features. 

**Recommended Skills:** Familiarity with Python and/or R. A basic knowledge of 
statistical concepts and a desire to learn the basics of Julia.

**Expected Results:** An interface for Pigeons in either Python or R (or both). 

**Mentors:** Alexandre Bouchard-Côté, Trevor Campbell, and Nikola Surjanovic

**Expected Project Size:** 175 hours or 350 hours. 

**Difficulty:** Medium.
