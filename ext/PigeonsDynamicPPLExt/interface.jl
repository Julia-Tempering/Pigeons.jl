            We recommend using SliceSampler() for Turing models. If you have a large continuous model
            consider using the BridgeStan. The Turing interface is still useful for models containing
            both continuous and discrete variables.

            Details:

            - The LogDensityProblems interface seems to force us to keep two representations of the states,
              one for the VariableInfo and one vector based. This is only partly implemented at the moment,
              as a result we have the following limitations: (1) AutoMALA+Turing cannot use the
              diagonal pre-conditioning at the moment. (2) AutoMALA+Turing only works if all variables are
              continuous at the moment. Both could be addressed but since the autodiff is pretty slow at the
              moment it seems low priority; the user can just rely on SliceSampler() at the moment.
            - If the user has a fully continuous model, there is a good alternative: the Stan Bridge,
              (which has much faster autodiff than Zygote, and Enzyme crashes on Turing at the time of writing).
            - On some Turing models, gradient computation is non-deterministic,
