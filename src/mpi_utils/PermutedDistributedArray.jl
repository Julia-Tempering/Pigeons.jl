"""
A distributed array making special assumptions on how 
it will be accessed and written to. 
The indices of this distributed array correspond to the 
notion of "global indices" defined in [`LoadBalance`](@ref). 
Several MPI processes cooperate, each process storing 
data for a slice of this distributed array. 

We make the following assumptions:

- Each MPI process will set/get 
    entries the same number of times in their lifetime, at 
    logically related episodes (e.g. a set 
    number of times per iteration for algorithms running the 
    same number of iterations). 
    These episodes are called micro-iterations as in [`Entangler`](@ref), 
    which this datastructure is built on.

- Moreover, at each time all processes perform a get or a set, 
    we assume that each global index is manipulated by exactly one 
    process (i.e. an implicit permutation of the global indices).

We use these assumptions to achieve read/write costs that are 
near-constant in the number of machines participating. 

This struct contains:

$FIELDS

The operations supported are:

- [`permuted_get()`](@ref)
- [`permuted_set!()`](@ref)
